# Object-Oriented Programming Examples in Python

This project contains a Python script demonstrating fundamental object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

## Overview

The `OOP.py` file includes two main examples:

1. **Table Tennis Game Classes**  
   - Demonstrates inheritance and polymorphism with a base class `TableTennisGame` and derived classes `Duce` and `Win`.  
   - Shows how different game states can be represented with polymorphic behavior.

2. **Means of Transport Classes**  
   - Demonstrates polymorphism with different transport classes (`Car`, `Plane`, `Ship`) each implementing a `move` method.  
   - Illustrates how different objects can be treated uniformly through polymorphism.

## Concepts Demonstrated

- **Inheritance:** Derived classes inherit properties and methods from a base class.  
- **Polymorphism:** Methods in derived classes override base class methods to provide specific behavior.  
- **Encapsulation:** Data is encapsulated within classes and accessed through methods.

## How to Run

To run the script, ensure you have Python 3 installed and execute:

```bash
python OOP.py
```

This will print the results of the table tennis match simulations and the movement of different means of transport.
